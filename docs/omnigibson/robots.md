# :material-robot-outline: **Robots**

![Robot Family](../assets/robots/robot_family.png)

## Description

In **`OmniGibson`**, `Robot`s define agents that can interact with other objects in a given environment. Each robot can _interact_ by deploying joint
commands via its set of [`Controller`](./controllers.md)s, and can _perceive_ its surroundings via its set of [`Sensor`](./sensors.md)s. 

**`OmniGibson`** supports both navigation and manipulation robots, and allows for modular specification of individual controllers for controlling the different components of a given robot. For example, the `Fetch` robot is a mobile manipulator composed of a mobile (two-wheeled) base, two head joints, a trunk, seven arm joints, and two gripper finger joints. `Fetch` owns 4 controllers, one for controlling the base, the head, the trunk + arm, and the gripper. There are multiple options for each controller depending on the desired action space. For more information, check out our [robot examples](../getting_started/examples.md#robots).

It is important to note that robots are full-fledged `StatefulObject`s, and thus leverage the same APIs as normal scene objects and can be treated as such. Robots can be thought of as `StatefulObject`s that additionally own controllers (`robot.controllers`) and sensors (`robot.sensors`).

## Usage

### Importing

Robots can be added to a given `Environment` instance by specifying them in the config that is passed to the environment constructor via the `robots` key. This is expected to be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies the desired configuration for a single robot to be created. For each dict, the `type` key is required and specifies the desired robot class, and global `position` and `orientation` (in (x,y,z,w) quaternion form) can also be specified. Additional keys can be specified and will be passed directly to the specific robot class constructor. An example of a robot configuration is shown below in `.yaml` form:

??? code "single_fetch_config_example.yaml"
    ``` yaml linenums="1"
    robots:
      - type: Fetch
        position: [0, 0, 0]
        orientation: [0, 0, 0, 1]
        obs_modalities: [scan, rgb, depth]
        scale: 1.0
        self_collision: false
        action_normalize: true
        action_type: continuous
        grasping_mode: physical
        rigid_trunk: false
        default_trunk_offset: 0.365
        default_arm_pose: diagonal30
        reset_joint_pos: tuck
        sensor_config:
          VisionSensor:
            sensor_kwargs:
              image_height: 128
              image_width: 128
          ScanSensor:
              sensor_kwargs:
                min_range: 0.05
                max_range: 10.0
        controller_config:
          base:
            name: DifferentialDriveController
          arm_0:
            name: InverseKinematicsController
            kv: 2.0
          gripper_0:
            name: MultiFingerGripperController
            mode: binary
          camera:
            name: JointController
            use_delta_commands: False
    ```



### Runtime

Usually, actions are passed to robots and observations retrieved via the `obs, info, terminated, truncated, done = env.step(action)`. However, actions can be directly deployed and observations retrieved from the robot using the following APIs:

<div class="annotate" markdown>
- **Applying actions**: `robot.apply_action(action)` (1)

- **Retrieving observations**: `obs, info = robot.get_obs()` (2)
</div>

1. `action` is a 1D-numpy array. For more information, please see the [Controller](./controllers.md) section!
2. `obs` is a dict mapping observation name to observation data, and `info` is a dict of relevant metadata about the observations. For more information, please see the [Sensor](./sensors.md) section!


Controllers and sensors can be accessed directly via the `controllers` and `sensors` properties, respectively. And, like all objects in **`OmniGibson`**, common information such as joint data and object states can also be directly accessed from the `robot` class. Note that by default, control signals are updated and deployed every physics timestep via the robot's internal `step()` callback function. To disable controllers from automatically deploying control signals, set `robot.control_enabled = False`. This means that additional `step()` calls will **not** update the control signals sent, and so the most recent control signal will still be propagated until the user either re-enables control or manually sets the robot's joint positions / velocities / efforts.


## Types
**`OmniGibson`** currently supports 12 robots, consisting of 4 mobile robots, 3 manipulation robots, 4 mobile manipulation robots, and 1 anthropomorphic "robot" (a bimanual agent proxy used for VR teleoperation). Below, we provide a brief overview of each model:

### Mobile Robots
These are navigation-only robots (an instance of [`LocomotionRobot`](../reference/robots/locomotion_robot.md)) that solely consist of a base that can move.

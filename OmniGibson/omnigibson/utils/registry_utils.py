class Registry:
    """
    Simple class for easily registering and tracking arbitrary objects of the same (or very similar) class types.

    Elements added are automatically organized by attributes specified by @unique_keys and @group_keys, and
    can be accessed at runtime by specifying the desired key and indexing value to grab the object(s).

    Default_key is a 1-to-1 mapping: i.e.: a single indexing value will return a single object.
        default: "name" -- indexing by object.name (i.e.: every object's name should be unique)
    Unique_keys are other 1-to-1 mappings: i.e.: a single indexing value will return a single object.
        example: indexing by object.name (every object's name should be unique)
    Group_keys are 1-to-many mappings: i.e.: a single indexing value will return a set of objects.
        example: indexing by object.in_rooms (many objects can be in a single room)

    Note that if a object's attribute is an array of values, then it will be stored under ALL of its values.
        example: object.in_rooms = ["kitchen", "living_room"], indexing by in_rooms with a value of either kitchen OR
            living room will return this object as part of its set!

    You can also easily check for membership in this registry, via either the object's name OR the object itself,
    e.g.:

        > object.name in registry
        > object in registry

        If the latter, note that default_key attribute will automatically be used to search for the object
